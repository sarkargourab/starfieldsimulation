**README.md - Star Field Simulation**

# 🌌 Star Field Simulation  
A mesmerizing Java-based animation of stars moving through space. Built with Swing for GUI rendering.

## 🚀 Demo  
![Star Field Demo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/000000/FFFFFF?text=Star+Field+Simulation)  
*(Replace with actual GIF/video after uploading)*

---

## ✨ Features  
- **Smooth parallax-like star movement**  
- **Configurable star count (1000 stars by default)**  
- **Random star sizes (1-5 pixels)**  
- **Black background with white stars**  
- **Continuous animation loop**  
- **Responsive window handling**

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites  
- Java JDK 11+  
- Maven (optional, for potential future build setup)

---

## 📥 Installation & Usage  
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-field-simulation.git

# 2. Compile (from src directory)
javac Main.java StarFieldPanel.java Star.java

# 3. Run
java Main
```

---

## 🔧 Customization  
Modify these constants in `StarFieldPanel.java`:
```java
private static final int WIDTH = 800;         // Window width
private static final int HEIGHT = 600;        // Window height
private static final int NUM_STARS = 1000;    // Number of stars
private static final int MAX_SIZE = 5;        // Maximum star size (in paintComponent)
private static final int ANIMATION_DELAY = 20;// Refresh rate in milliseconds
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details  
**Architecture**:
- `Main.java`: Entry point with JFrame setup
- `Star.java`: Data class for star properties
- `StarFieldPanel.java`: Core animation logic and rendering

**Key Mechanisms**:
- Thread-based animation loop (60 FPS cap)
- Star recycling system (stars wrap around screen)
- Double buffering via Swing's paintComponent

## 📚 Possible Enhancements  
- [ ] Add parallax effect (multiple star layers)  
- [ ] Implement user-controlled spaceship  
- [ ] Add color variations based on star size  
- [ ] Create speed control slider  
- [ ] Add particle trail effects  
- [ ] Implement mouse interaction
